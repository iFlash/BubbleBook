BubbleBook Version 2.0 (c) 2025 by Armin Hierstetter


1. Installation
Copy BUBBLE.ACC to the root of your boot device.

2. Usage
BubbleBook was initially written for the ST BOOK. Because of the ST Book's
insanely bad display, the mouse pointer constantly gets lost when moved.

BubbleBook helps finding the pointer by showing a blinking speech bubble ("I'm
here!") next to the pointer when the right mouse button is pressed. You can
define a set of hotkeys (right shift, left shift, alternate, control) that need
to be pressed simultaneously to trigger the speech bubble. Users with big
screens might find it useful, too, to quickly identify the position of a "lost"
mouse pointer.

You can save your settings (on/off status and hotkey) by clicking "SAVE".
BubbleBook stores the settings inside the accessory file itself, not a seperate
.cfg file.

3. Compatibility
BubbleBook will work on any Atari ST/Mega ST/STE/Mega STE/TT/Falcon with any
program that allows accessories. If you come across conflicts, you might turn
BubbleBook off. This can be done by opening the accessory from the Desktop
menu. A dialog box will appear where you can toggle BubbleBook on and off.
